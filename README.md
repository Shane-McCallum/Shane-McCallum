### Hi there <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">

My name is Shane McCallum! As a Data Scientist, I have developed a solid foundation of technical and interpersonal skills that have enabled me to succeed in all aspects of the data science field. I am confident in my ability to lead a team on a project; communicate the findings and recommendations of an analysis; or assist in the development of advanced machine learning algorithms. I thrive on tackling complex and difficult problems and employ advanced technical tools to educate, inform, and propel businesses.

With my skills in data science and sociology, I am eager to use data to inform business professionals with the facts and truth that the data presents. However, as a data scientist, I recognize the need to ethically consider the humanitarian, environmental, and economical impact of data and how to best present such findings.
